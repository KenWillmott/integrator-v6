# integrator-v6
guitar pickup test integrator V6.x

This hardware version of the integrator replaces the much older V5.8/V5.9 integrator.
General information about the integrator project is found here, along with the older design files:

https://github.com/KenWillmott/integrator/wiki

The newer V6.0 is a smaller, more integrated version of the same circuit, with upgraded components. It is possible to order a build from the factory. There are two BOM's. One is for the SMT assembly only, and omits the connector and switch parts. The other is a complete build, with all components, including switches and connectors. It is a fully functional integrator, needs only to be calibrated to work. A case or enclosure is recommended, So far an aluminum and an acrylic case have been used.
