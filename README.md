# integrator-v6
guitar pickup test integrator V6.x

This hardware version of the integrator replaces the much older V5.8/V5.9 integrator.
General information about the integrator project is found here, along with the older design files:

https://github.com/KenWillmott/integrator/wiki

The newer V6.0 is a smaller, more integrated version of the same circuit, with upgraded components. It is possible to order a build from the factory. The BOM is a complete build, with all components, including switches and connectors. It is a fully functional integrator, needs only to be calibrated to work. A case or enclosure is recommended, So far an aluminum and an acrylic case have been used. It is possible to special order the boards without switches and connectors by noting them DNP on a modified BOM.

Complete BOM: [BOM-V601(2025-04-11).xls](https://github.com/KenWillmott/integrator-v6/blob/main/BOM-V601(2025-04-11).xls)

The project is listed at the PCBWay site, you can place an multi-board order there by following the ordering links and specifying "PCB+Assembly".
[PCBWay order link](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/W22492BSH46_integrator_V6_Gerber_e358a0f5.html)

Note that you can produce the PCB by any method, by importing the KiCad project and exporting the necessary fabrication files.
